    <h1>Kensho Challenge: Frontend Application</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Traders and analysts need to stay informed about the companies that they trade. With the number of publicly traded companies constantly growing, it is becoming more and more difficult to stay informed on each individual one.</p>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>To create an application that helps users quickly get up-to-date on the status of a company.</p>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Kensho has a few different products that helps our clients stay updated about a company or group of companies. For example, we have an app that allows you to query for a company to see how its price history has been affected by related events. We also have an app that allows you to query for an event or eventset to investigate how events of a particular type affect a group of companies.</p>
    <p>In this challenge, you are to create an app that helps your users quickly get a deep understanding of a company. The design of the app is up to you. You may find the following APIs helpful; feel free to use any or none of them, or any other APIs that you have access to</p>

    <h1>Kensho Challenge: Data Visualization</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>One of Kensho’s most valuable assets is our massive graph database full of events, companies, products, people, etc. One of our most difficult problems is figuring out the best way to display our data in an easily-digestible format.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>To create an informative visualization around a dataset.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>In this challenge, you are to create an app/visualization that helps your users quickly get a deep understanding of a dataset. You may find the following datasets interesting; feel free to use any or none of them, or any other datasets that you have access to (but please do not use one you’re already familiar with).</p>

    <h1>Kensho Challenge: Machine Learning</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>At Kensho, our world revolves around events. We pride ourselves in having a knowledge graph rich with information about everything happening in the financial world. To do this, our systems are constantly scanning the web looking for new information to integrate into our graph. One problem we often have is figuring out when data is actually new - for example, if multiple news outlets are reporting on the same event.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>To build an intelligent system to tell when news articles are about the same event.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>In this challenge, you will examine a dataset of news articles and build an intelligent system for ingesting news articles and digesting them into a series of groups of articles about events. First, ingest the dataset at <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news/data' target='_blank'>https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news/data</a>, and spit out some aggregation of news articles demonstrating your system’s ability to recognize events.</p>

    <h1>Crimson Challenge: Fake/Biased News</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Fake news and biased news have become more and more prevalent over the last few years. The presence of such news makes it difficult for readers to identify when sources are reliable, true, and impartial. This in turn can lead to confusion, echo chambers, and a misinformed public.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>To create a tool to identify and quantify fake and biased news.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The Crimson is invested in providing complete and unbiased coverage of news to its readers. However, there are more news outlets than our own, and we want our readers to be wary and cautious when reading anything online, especially from less reputable sources.</p>

    <p>In this challenge, you will create an application that helps users identify and understand the bias and truth in the news they read in any publication. Be warned: this is a hard problem, but a successful implementation will be rewarded accordingly!</p>

    <p>Some sites to consider testing on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='http://www.foxnews.com/' target='_blank'>http://www.foxnews.com/</a></li>
      <li><a href='https://www.cnn.com/' target='_blank'>https://www.cnn.com/</a></li>
      <li><a href='http://www.bbc.com/' target='_blank'>http://www.bbc.com/</a></li>

    <h1>Crimson Challenge: Content Management</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The Crimson is published daily and that means that we need to create and manage large amounts of content in the form of writing, picture, videos, and more. At times, managing and maintaining a large database of content can be difficult and frustrating.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>To create an application that allows for the creation and management of content</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>We currently have stable methods of storing our content, but it is difficult to collaborate and search past content. In this challenge, you will build an application that allows writers to easily collaborate and compose pieces of content as well as search old content.</p>

    <h1>Crimson Challenge: Polling</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Recently, the Crimson conducted exit polling for the unionization voting, and our data collection and analysis allowed us to correctly predict the outcome of the vote. Polling is an important part of the Crimson’s content and is a large part of our freshman and senior surveys.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>To create an application that allows for customizable polling and then live visualization and analysis of the results.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The process of collecting exit polls was surprisingly manual and difficult. In this challenge, you will create an application that allows for anonymous, secure, and customizable polling that can easily export its data for visualization or packages visualization directly into the application.</p>
